# Contingency Tables, Chi-Square, and Sampling

This is based off of an assignment from class using numbers provided. 

## Part 1: Chi-Square Testing
We investigate if there are pairwise differences in the exons by doing the following:

•	Constructing a barplot that shows the distribution of the nucleotides across the exons

•	Conducting a chi-square test between each of the pairs

## Part 2: Sampling
After understanding similiarities and differences, we will make fake DNA strands from those classifications. Each strand will have 300 nucleotides and the DNA strands will need to make sense relative to the distributions at an alpha level of .05.

Then we create while loops to find how many samples it will take you to reach a circumstance where the fake DNA strands do not conform to the specifications of the groups.  We use an alpha level of .01 for this task.
